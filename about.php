					<h1>
						I think About pages are stupid.
					</h1>
					
					<p>
						Generally speaking this is where some Mission Statement or something would go or some sort of TOC or contact information. I'm not going to give you the pleasure of that until you hear my little rant
						about why I think these types of pages are generally useless and I find awkward to make.
					</p>
					<p>
						In this little space you're supposed to define what you're site is, and if find that half the time that what the developers (or persons they develop the site for) say their sites is about is usually wrong. 
						I say this because often times how users user your site is completely different than you would like to delude yourself they do. This is unless you actually design things really well or only have a few 
						restricted things they are capable of doing on your site. Guess you have to keep things simple to have an effective site in which no one gets lost or can't figure out what to do. You can completely argue 
						that my point is in itself incorrect and that there are usually lots of sites with very coherent <em>About</em> pages, however this isn't always the case.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's always some useless phrases that a marketing department came up with or some few sentneces and sentiment that are supposed to run deep but are generally really shallow. The problem is that those
						who make these websites or have websites made for them are have no idea what they even do.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Websites serve a purpose.
					</h2>
					<p>
						The biggest problem I have with <em>About</em> pages is that they're supposed to tell you about the business, or intentions or persons responsible for the service it provides; well why don't you just have 
						a <em>History</em> or <em>Contact Information</em> page, why do you have to have an <em>About</em> page? The word "about" is so completely vague without context that it drives me insane. Is it about the 
						website? the business? or is it about phone numbers? A little organization goes a long way and I'd hate to say it but if you don't label things properly, users are not going to know what the hell you're
						going on about. Having to work with people who are completely computer illiterate has taught me that either people click everything and fall for stupid pit falls or are just smart enough to never click
						anything. I run into the latter more than I would like to admit. More often than not I run into the "why didn't you just click that?", "I didn't know what was going to happen if I did".
					</p>
					<p>
						<img src="http://i962.photobucket.com/albums/ae108/twarry/GIFs/headdesk.gif" /> <small>&lt;-- not actually me</small>
					</p>
					<p>
						They're scared of the unknown and you not properly labelling things is causing problems.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Stop trying to fill the void that doesn't exist.
					</h2>
					<p>
						If find that they often lack any sort of serious purpose. It's a compelte waste of time. It feels like people often make these sorts of pages because they feel like they need to fill some sort of void
						like their website can't function properly without them explaining a few things to you first. If you're website is made well this type of bullshit is completely irrelevant.
					</p>
					<p>
						Perhaps they're afarid they're not providing you with enough content.
					</p>
					<p>
						You should know why people are here and what they're looking for and what would be the most efficient way to deliver to them the information, product or service.
					</p>
					<h3>
						Example time
					</h3>
					<p>
						clearskyy.net is about articles.
					</p>
					<p>
						The reason you and I are here is to read (hopefully) interesting things about you may (or may not) care about. I throw so many different ways for you to access any of them its kind of disgusting.
						The only real thing I'm missing at this point is searching and I'm probably going to implement that as soon as I can find a way that works without any sort of problems. I'd expect it to 
						roll out some time in the future when I stop messing around with other fun things that I want this site to do.
					</p>
					<p>
						We also have videos and other crap here too, and hopefully we'll have a more diverse collection of media for visitors to enjoy in the near future, but for now its mostly text and YouTube videos. Who knows
						maybe when I actually get my game up and running, I'll post the betas here. I would like to act as place to download certain things but we're not on a dedicated server or have a data center or anything
						like that so, it's not realistic yet.
					</p>
					
					<h1>
						Well what is this site actually about though?
					</h1>
					<p>
						As previously stated <small>(tl;dr)</small>, this site is about articles. Specifically about gaming, and gaming culture. This means that we branch out into gadgets, services and just general things that
						we as gamers should be concerned about. Yes that includes health topics and basic life things as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						I try to keep things relevant, but there are so many sources for this type of information and this industry
						moves really fast so its hard to keep up with all the coupious amounts of information flooding the market at any given day. I have to say thought that Kotaku and Polygon do a very good job. They have
						staff though. I don't have that luxury, I have friends and weekend warriors who are willing to lend a hand. I greatly appreicate their contributions to this site and hope that they continue showing
						their support as things progress.
					</p>
					<p>
						<small>
						clearskyy:  On a personal level this is just a place for me to really show what sort of programming I'm capable of and a way to express myself through my writing as well a place for me to go to and enjoy, I actually 
						throughly enjoy going back and reading some of the older articles by some of the writers. Everything (for the most part) completely homebrewed with the exception of probably the slider on the homepage
						which I believe is open source and so I snagged it and use that since the sliders I've created over the years aren't as nice as that one.
						</small>
					</p>
					<h2>
						What sort of things should I expect to see coming?
					</h2>
					<p>
						As of right now, I'm working on creating a way for everyone to make users accounts and a database in which they can keep track of their games, and have a really easy way to list 
						and show off their collection to their friends in very concise and clear way. So far things are still in infancy but I hope to get things rolling some time in the next year. I have been getting some
						pretty good feedback about things as I try and develop things and that's helping to add some new things that I otherwise wouldn't have thought of at all.
					</p>
					<p>
						This means pages for games specifically with general information, our reviews on the game, score and all sorts of little tidbits of information.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm trying to get DROPD34D up and running, as the main hub for all clan activities across all the games we have clans in. I want to get some of the graphics and other logistics sorted and rolled out.
					</p>
					<h3>
						You're not going to be updating this any time soon after you make this are you?
					</h3>
					<p>
						hmm, I want to say that I will, but who knows if that'll ever happen. Like most <em>About</em> pages, this will probably be made and then ignored for several years, remember how I said these pages are
						useless?
