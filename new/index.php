	<h1>What the hell is clearskyy anyways?</h1>
	
	<p>This is something that I am constantly asking myself, honestly. </p>
	
	<p>What I want to see happen is this site totally shift, from being all about me, to being about the crap that me and my friends (and other people I enlist) decide what to write about. I'm talking gadgets, grammar, game consoles, games, movies, what the fuck ever, stupid stories that we might find other people find humourous. </p>
	
	<p>In the words of Halo: ODST, keep it clean. We'll try to stay humble but opinionated, open-minded yet firm, kind of like a memory foam mattress. </p>
