	<h3>A few thoughts on web design.</h3>
	<p>By my definition, web design should focus primarly on clean, premeditated organization of the content in which the site provides. Our focus should be on effective and well executed delivery of information. It also helps that the content be managed in a way that is visually appealing; as asthetics will surely generate more traffic to your site. Web design requires the knowledge of several different coding languages as well as how to produce digital photography, graphics, video and applications; I personally enjoy creating all the content on my site from scratch. I may use other tools that are availible on the internet and I make sure to include them somewhere on the page. Included at the bottom of the page is a list of the code or libraries which were used to create this page.</p>
	
	<p>The proposed purpose of this site is to showcase what I am capable of in a limited sort of way. I hope you enjoy.</p>

			<h4>Surviving Southern Ontario -  Brief Description</h4>
			<div>
				<p>
				This was my first multi-page web design project that I ever created, I thought that I would show where I started and where I am now, a sort of compare and contrast. It's really funny to go back and see what I thought was amazing and how proud I used to be of it. I still talk about going back and fixing it and I probably will, but under a different name so that I can keep that old site intact.
				</p>
				<p>
				It was also my first real project that used CSS, as you can see that the code is included in the pages instead of seperate as it should be. This was me getting my feet wet and it could have been worse honestly, even if it is slightly painful to look at.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Surviving Southern Ontario - Background</h4>
			<div>
				<p>The background is made with 1px wide gradient image that was repeated in the x-direction, instead of one large image. This increases the load speed of the page and requires less bandwidth and http calls.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Surviving Southern Ontario - Navigation</h4>
			<div>
				<p>The navigation's opacity changes on hover using CSS properties, a rather easy trick to pull off, however it was my first attempt at trying something that took into consideration all the different web browswer venders which wasn't an issue when coding straight HTML I didn't make sure that it works in ALL browswers, but all the major up to date ones.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Surviving Southern Ontario - Fx</h4>
			<div>
				<p>All effects are done by manipulating CSS3 properties.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Akwesasne Mohawk Casino - Brief Description</h4>
			<div>
				<p>
				This web project took an website that was 38 pages and cut the amount of pages down to about half the orignal. This was possible through the use of jQuery and it's associated libraries and tools developed by other sources that I used in order to create a new layout and them that was more visitor friendly and allowed for quicker access to information without having to leave the main page, which would expendently decreased the bounce rate for the client. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Even though the amount of pages was decreased the amount of information remained the same, we were simply able to accomodate more information per page instead of having redirects to smaller pages containing simple paragraphs, a lightbox would appear containing the additional information that was needed.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Akwesasne Mohawk Casino - Benefits of new design</h4>
			<div>
				<p>The new site design had a much shorter load time because bulker image heavy properties about the page were replaced by scripts that did the same thing or better. The new site design was less static and more interactive.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Akwesasne Mohawk Casino - Navigation</h4>
			<div>
				<p>Istead of relying on images to create the tabbed navigation the new design uses CSS3 properties for rounded borders and opacity changes so that images aren't necessary.
				</p>
				<p>
				The new navigation relies on a drop down menu system meaning that pages that ordinarly required to the visitor to click from page to page in order to get to certain pages was now able to go anywhere on the site no matter where they were located within the site.
			</div>
			<h4>Akwesasne Mohawk Casino - Background</h4>
			<div>
				<p>The new design used a CSS generated graident that was used for the background instead of a large image like the previous design, the only draw back was that Internet Explorer didn't support it so in IE was required that we repeat a small image in order to gain a similar effect.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Akwesasne Mohawk Casino - Browser Handling</h4>
			<div>
				<p>Each page included a script that detected which browser was viewing the site and called a different CSS document depending on the situation. Each CSS document was hand crafted to work with most browsers.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Akwesasne Mohawk Casino - New Features</h4>
			<div>
				<p>Included video embed as per client request. Completely new layout, content slider widget, and lightbox usage for efficency.</p>
			</div>
