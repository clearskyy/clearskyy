			I want to create an open discussion, there are just a few topics that really need to be expanded and argued. The best way to get to a solid answer is by hashing it out with a large group, things can get as micro or meta as they need to be, perhaps there is more than one solution, but that doesn't change the fact that everyone has an opinion about something and sometimes those opinions need to be heard, good or bad. In the end if I notice that the thread dies down and there appears to be a consensus, I will post the results at the top here. I don't want this to be based on majority so much as what appears the be the best answer, however there will be times where the majority rule is the answer, it depends on the context of the question or topic listed. Let's see how this goes, have at it.
