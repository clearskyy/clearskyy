	<h1>#Playstation2013</h1>
	
	<p id="date">January 31, 2012</p>
	
	<p>So it's thursday and it's almost time for me to leave work when my twitter feed pops up something interesting. There is a new teaser video out by Sony.</p>
	
	<p>Now it's not the most exciting video ever, but it does hint at Feburary 20, 2013 date which could mean a few things.
		<ol>
			<li>The Playstation 4 will be announced and the console wars will begin. </li>
			<li>Possible extras or expansion of the PSN network. </li>
			<li>The PS Vita has something interesting happening to it. </li>
			<li>A New playstation gaming device. </li>
			<li>Sony is creating the most exciting Tic-Tac-Toe game ever made which uses 4 shapes instead of two. </li>
			<li>The robot pirate ninja zombies outbreak occurs and Sony is sponsoring the event. </li>
		</ol>
	
	</p>
	
	<p>One of these may be true, and none of them may be true, it wouldn't be the first time a company like Sony has totally thrown me for a loop, for all I know it could be a blu-ray player that plays android apps, because that's what we need, angry birds on our dvd players.</p>
	
	<p style="background-color:#FFECC7;padding:5px;">EDIT: While writting this I have found sources that state that it will be in fact the Playstation 4 that will be revealed on Feburary 20th and all other assumptions are moot. So get ready to hear about the next gaming console coming out from Sony come the 20th!</p>
