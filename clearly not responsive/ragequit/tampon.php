	<blockquote>I want to start this by saying that this, <em>in my opinion</em> is completely fake. </blockquote>
	
	<p>There is nothing worse on the internet than an attention whore. The only thing worse than that is one that goes viral and gets exactly what they want. This is exactly what has happened in this case and it's completely rediculous. The fact that I have to write this #ragequit about it is sort of pathetic in its own regard. </p>
	
	<p>Now if you have more than just a brain stem you, you've probabaly already figured it out that this video is fake. However if you haven't yet, let me enlighten you.

			<li>
				<dl>
					<dt>Blood isn't that color. </dt>
					<dd>it looks a lot like red colored juice. </dd>
					<dd>If you've ever seen a used tampon, you should know it doesn't look like that. </dd>
				</dl>
			</li>
			<li>
				<dl>
					<dt>Her reactions don't feel natural.</dt>
					<dd>It looks a little forced and it seems that she has to <em>try</em> to be grossed out that she's sucking womb discharge. </dd>
					<dd>Lack of vomit: 9 of 10 times swallowing that amount of blood is going to cause some gurgles and gagging.</dd>
					<dd>She goes back for more! Most people would stop after the first <del>blood</del> taste</dd>
				</dl>
			</li>
			<li>
				<dl>
					<dt>She is <em>way</em> too eager to do this.</dt>
					<dd>she can't find a reason to do this and yet she must; oh wait, all the views this will get, that must be a pretty good incentive. </dd>
				</dl>
			</li>
			<li>
				<dl>
					<dt>I've been bored before.</dt>
					<dd>That's never driven me to do things that would emotionally scar most people. </dd>
				</dl>

	<p>I wonder what she was thinking, how would this benefit her other than making her look like a disgusting person. It's not like people are going to pay you for sucking on filthy femaine cleaning products. Attempting to use infamy to your advantage should back-fire in the most horrific way possible, which it has in the past, I'm just crossing my fingers a little extra tight on this one. I'm not saying that she should incure injury, but if she missed a step and fell over I wouldn't feel bad about laughing about it.</p>
	
	<p>So let that be a lesson kids, if you can't find a way to be popular by being entertaining, or having a talent; do something really disgusting. At least you'll get your 15 minutes on twitter or some random post on a friends facebook wall, but not more than that. Honestly if anything else comes out as a result of that video, I've lost hope for our media.</p>
	
	<p>I say this because in the back of my mind I can see some disgusting Fear Factor type television program coming out of this, where she hosts and/or stars on it. Television channels like MTV love to produce shit like this for some obsurd reason. The last thing we need is another <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_World">The Real World</a> / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Rules">Road Rules</a> </em> type shit happening again, that series honestly lasted than any <a href="reality-shows.php">reality series</a> should last. I can see it now, she races against contestants to see which horrific substance they can tolerate to have in their oral cavitity the longest or swallow massive quantities of other disgusting bodily fluids.<p>
