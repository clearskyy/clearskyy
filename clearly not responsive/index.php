		<h3>What the hell is clearskyy anyways?</h3>
		</div>
		
		<p>This is something that I am constantly asking myself, honestly. </p>
		
		<p>So, this website is something that I work on in my spare time and am constantly building and adding more and changing to make it better in any way that I can. Sometimes you have to completely change designs to find one that is completely effective and that's what I hope to achieve with this design.</p> 
		
		<p>Right now I want to say that the site is in beta, but it's completely open to explore, open beta. Things will change, but I will try to keep them from being overly drastic to the point it's disorienting. Any changes are however made with the intent of making your experience more enjoyable, not because it's just flashy and cool (though admittedly sometimes this is the exact reason I add something, it's give and take, remember this is a beta).</p>
		
		<p>What I want to see happen is this site totally shift, from being all about me, to being about the crap that me and my friends (and other people I enlist) decide what to write about. I'm talking gadgets, grammar, game consoles, games, movies, what the fuck ever, stupid stories that we might find other people find humourous. </p>
		
		<p>In the words of Halo: ODST, keep it clean. We'll try to stay humble but opinionated, open-minded yet firm, kind of like a memory foam mattress. </p>
