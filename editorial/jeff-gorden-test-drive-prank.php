	<h1>Jeff Gordon Test Drive Prank</h1>

	<p>Here's a little video that <a href="../profiles/demonphoenix37">demonphoenix37</a> said I should look up and it's definitely worth the watch, it rofl'd my copters pretty good. As you can tell by the preview image, this guy's face is priceless and his reaction throughout the whole thing is pretty funny. You gotta love it when a prank leads to yelling, fear and death threats.</p>
	
	<p>I have to say that Jeff can really drive, it's pretty impressive, I wouldn't mind taking a crazy drift around town in a Camaro. </p>
	
	<p>Amazingness aside, there is something constantly nagging me in the back of my mind. Pepsi is paying for this, so, paid actor? or is this legit, it's hard to say. The skeptic in my wants to say that this isn't real and that it's just made to look that way. However I want to believe that they did this, mainly because if its an actor, then it's not really funny anymore, then it's just sort of lame.</p>
	
	<p>Even if the prank itself is real on the dealer, you can tell that Jeff practiced this, it was choreographed pretty well and I have to give them props for that. Even the car nonchalantly cruising down the road was a nice touch. Real or not, it's a good video and I personally enjoyed it.</p>
