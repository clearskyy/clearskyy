	<h1>blogTV merger with YouNow</h1>
	</div>

	<div class="content-clearskyy">
	
	<p>So, I just received this email and I open it and it says that blogTV will stop being a thing and will be joining up with YouNow and gives you a cool 7 days to migrate your account or forever lose your shit. awesome. Couldn't you have given me a little more time to give a shit? I have things to do rather than migrating my account. I understand it only takes a good 5 minutes, but don't you realize I have cat videos to watch and you bother me with this?</p>

	 <p><strong>blogTV is joining forces with YouNow!</strong></p>

	<p>After an unbelievably epic, emotional and exciting 7 year ride, ...</p> 
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>Easy there blogTV, you're not that epic <em>or</em> exciting, last I checked you were a place for underage girls to show themselves off for free or something, I'm not sure. Its just rumors and people making posts on tumblr or reddit or where ever you can post a screencap. That site was kind of weird if you ask me, and a bunch of creepy people who have no business on YouTube finding a way to get attention that they aren't receiving in real life. At any rate it goes on.<p>
	
	<blockquote>
	blogTV will be turning over a new leaf and merging with the live streaming company, YouNow!
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>Good. <em>Actually,</em> this might be bad for YouNow, sure they get new users, but honestly do you want those kind of users? 
	
	<p>I only know YouNow becuase MattG has streamed on that site a few times and from what I could tell these sites are similar but the better was obvious. It's not that it really matters unless you know someone on there or stalk YouTubers to the max.</p>
	
	<blockquote>
	As part of this exciting new partnership, blogTV will redirect to YouNow and will operate under the YouNow brand. You will be able to migrate your account to YouNow and enjoy special benefits (accorded to you as a blogTV user) and new features
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>Doesn't sound so much a partnership as a surrender of your clients to the healthier predator in the internet wilderness, Darwinism at it's finest. I'm not exactly sure what extra benefit, if any, you receive for being a migrated member, seems like just fluff they put into their email in order to not make this sound like a total pain in the ass and just making a new account with YouNow to skip all their bullshit. Unless you pay to use blogTV, you might as well just ignore this all together. Thanks for the shitty blogTV sticker on my profile, it made that merger totally worth it. <small>If you actually do this and receive something in return, feel free to call me out in a comment. Nothing I love more than being antagonized for sarcasm.</small></p>

		<p>By migrating your account you will be able to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Keep your blogTV username</li>
			<li>Keep all the friends and subscribers you made on blogTV</li>
			<li>Keep your past blogTV recordings</li>
			<li>Keep your blogTV status / registration date</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Upon migrating your account, you will also gain unique levels and rewards based on your blogTV site activity, seniority, number of subscribers, PRO membership and more! Please note that you will need to login via Facebook in order to migrate your blogTV account to YouNow.</p>
		<p>...</p>
		<p><strong>The deadline to transfer your account is March 27th, 2013. </strong></p>
		<p><strong>Please note that after this date you will no longer be able to access your blogTV account and will not be able to secure your username, social connections and recordings.</strong></p>

	<p>I really don't like my blogTV username, I was probably in my teens and an idiot when I made this account and from what I could <small>(or can't since its been so long)</small> remember I couldn't change it. </p>
	
	<p>I'm pretty sure I don't know anyone who uses blogTV anymore, this was a fad that died in a month. </p>
	
	<p>I'm okay with never seeing those recordings ever again, thanks. </p>
	
	<p>I'm sure this will be a big deal to <em>someone</em> but it sure as hell doesn't really bother me. I don't exactly use a service like this anyways, and the people that I do know have long since moved from blogTV to begin with, honestly this is probably a smart move on blogTV's account. Perhaps one day I'll become a vlogger to some degree but I wouldn't have chosen blogTV for that anyways. I'm sure a few people will be upset and hate the merger and having to change all their format and whatever around, but you know what? First world problems, get over it. </p>
	
	<p>As I remember if you wanted to acutally make a buck off that site you had to really push it and do some marathoning or something, you really had to get people's attention and more often than not it was some female exposing themselves at the right times when the admins weren't paying attention or they had some lame gimmic. Honestly I would have been happy leaving blogTV to be a sad little corner of the internet somewhere else, but its being taken over, so alls well that ends well. Farewell blogTV and long live YouNow.</p>
