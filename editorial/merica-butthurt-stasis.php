		<p>There are better things to worry about than trying to decipher whether video games will trigger aggression in individuals. In this article they bring up some good points across the spectrum but the thing that got me was the competitiveness of the game study. They discovered in this test that games with competition caused aggression not the ones without aka pretty much all online games (which btw are all rated M or NR for their obvious reasons). This to me is like reading that playing football or any other sport will trigger aggression and aka lead to violence. It's completely stupid. </p>

		<p>There are equal chances from any source of activity that would trigger the sick delusions of select individual. Stop trying to blame the media we consume but instead the individual. Why do you think there are rating systems for movies, games etc.? It's an obvious measure to prevent susceptible parties aka children/influential minds to fall victim of content they may be sensitive too on all levels physically and mentally.</p> 

		<p>In which case if someone is that influenced by things then it could have been done by any number of things. Not just one unless you can prove that said person spent all their time just consuming the same media day in day out for hours on end. Even then, example here, if you read a book with a depressing story are you going to kill yourself? I'd hope not but you are probably left feeling sad. Another example read same moving depressing story but you have been depressed prior to said reading. The effects are dramatically different! One source is highly unlikely to trigger a radical emotion in the same way a combined effort can. We just can't tailor all media to suit the minority which is the momentarily emotionally unstable. Not everybody wants to consume G rated material.</p>

		<p>So I guess I'll leave you with this: There are countless other problems at hand in the world other than the unfortunate tragedies such as the shootings that have happened over the course of time. Getting all butthurt will not change what happened. Bad things happen everywhere everyday. The US is no exception. </p>

		<p>May God have mercy on the soul(s) of the bastard(s) who decide to get all shot happy and my deepest sympathy goes out to the victims and their families.</p>
