		<p>Dis fucker right hurr is down’s proof. Seriously! My sister’s husband’s cousin’s brother has downs and he took this fucker; deek in one hand controller in the other, drool running all over the fucking place and managed to plug this fucker into the USB port after half hour of crying and smashing his deek into the fans. Once the connection was made it changed him. His IQ literally went up 600 points, figuratively. He was no longer a button mashing faggot. We fired up black cawks 2. I was on my pro leet fucking super gaming computer of the gods and he was playing on my shit bawks amd sempron with the controller. I am a level double super hacker bro with all aim bots and dis fucker with the controller was killing me all da time. He went 7000 to 0. I’m like hax bro and he’s light “nah”. And I’m like HAX BRO! And he’s like “nah”. And I’m like MOTHER FUCKING HAX BRO!!!1! I know a HAXORS when I sees one. Then he looked me deeply in the eyes, unplugged the controller, sprinted across the room and started choking me with de motherfucking cord...</p>
		<p>Lesson learned: Xbox controller is better than a hand job from a taiwanease with a bottle of ketcup. And secondly, never piss off a kid with downs who’s forearm is huge from jackin his shit all day. </p>

		<p>This controller dropped my IQ 600 points so now I'm able to enjoy all the games I play, and get all the kills and not think of the social implications of my actions and how these violent games are slowly making me a sociopath! yay! Maybe it was all the free candy that came with the limited edition version 2.0 that I bought off craigslist. </p>
	
		<p>This controller is going to be winning all the beauty pageant, AND it comes in two flavours: vanilla and chocolate, I heard there was blueberry and strawberry as well that you can scratch and sniff. I heard that if you are 1337 doe you scratch off the lead paint and eat it you can talk with Charlie the Unicorn. Charlie takes me to candy mountain, and his bright orange candy holders are fun to shake and he says I can have as many candies as I want and they come in all sorts of colors and shapes and sizes! they make the rainbow inside of me! like how this controller makes the rainbows come out of my tv! when i play with the controller, its magic! well technically witchcraft since I had to sell my soul and kill my little brother and place his dead body on top of this satanic circle and sing these songs until this dark void came and ate him, its okay, now I'm 10 times prestige on black cawks 2. </p>
		
		<p>this mofo lights up! you see that green light!? never have in my LYFE have I seen a controller that lights up with such pretty colors! my favourite! GR33N!!!, and it swirls and blinds me while playing but this troller makes you so freaking 1337 that, that don't matter you can't see any more, you get teh k3333lz, 411 th3 k333lz!!! x INFINITE</p>
	
		<p>I threw this controller at the wall and it bounced back in my hands and I got a 360 spin mid-air headshot from across the map. I love this controller in the most inappropriate way possible. If you don't get it, I will come to your house and eat everything in your house and then poop on all the walls in your house.</p>
