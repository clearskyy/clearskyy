		<p>If its one thing that I can't stand, it's horrible television programming. There is nothing more horrible than "Reality" television. First off, reality television isn't even close to reality, if it were, no one in their right mind would watch it. Reality is boring, nothing happens, this is why we have the internet and television, to escape from reality, so why do we insist on watching this "reality" programming?</p>
		
		<p>I will admit that what is on screen did occur at some point, that part is correct, however I think there is something that most people tend to not understand, ignore or flat out or are complete unaware of; and this little concept is:</p>
		
		<p>editing.</p>
		
	</div>
	<div class="content">
		
		<p>Editing is a powerful tool. It is 100% exploited in reality television, they crop out chunks of time, put things in different context. Depending how they decide to edit the footage they receive, they can twist the story any way they want. This is where I think people kind of stray, they don't realize that; these produces aren't just trimming the fat off their television programs to get to the interesting parts of the show. The produces/editors of these shows are telling a story, and they're doing it exactly how they want to and they play their audiences like a fiddle.</p>

		<p>I don't care how real these television programs <em>seem</em>, they're all fake in terms how of things happen. It's like having your shitfaced friend telling you how their night progressed, it's all bullshit and it probably didn't happen that way, it's just how they perceived it to happen.</p>
		
	</div>
	<div class="content">
		
		<p>This is the part where people come in and say well; how about Teen Mom, it's not like faked having those kids. Look, I'm not saying that what happens on these shows isn't happening. I'm just saying that they're staged and/or the people on these shows have help, or they got money. I don't remember seeing anyone on any of these MTV shows who didn't have enough money to get through several seasons of these shows. Maybe the stations put them through it, or they have it by other means, at any rate, no one is dying on these shows and no one is acting like a rational human fucking being. The drama that is sturred up in these shows is so rediculous that it drives me insane, people that I've met in my life, through my home town and college have not sturred up the kind of shit that I have seen on these shows. They feel provoked, and or suggested and influenced from the show. </p>
		
	</div>
	<div class="content">
	
		<p>Another thing is that all everyone who shows up on these shows all have make up or their hair done. There are times when they aren't made up the best and they do cry and stuff with messes up their face, but overall the people who are in these shows aren't that unkempt or gross. </p>
		
		<p>Advertisements, at first they were blurred out, but I'm starting to slowly notice that certain brands aren't censored and or that the people who appear on these shows are wearing particular brands and its really clever how they managed to do this and make it seems so natural. Some of it has to do with clever camera angles which these shows are getting good at.</p>
		
	</div>
	<div class="content">
	
		<p>To finish up, I just want to say that these isn't a complete ragequit on this, to this day I find more and more in these shows that I absolutely get annoyed about. It probably has to do with taking those film editing courses. I'm sure I'll be writing about this again sometime, for now, I'll just watch the insanity and shake my head. </p>
